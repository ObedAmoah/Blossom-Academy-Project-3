# Blossom-Academy-Project-3

This Project was to study the pattern of promotion to be used to predict promotion eligibility. 
A comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) using the training dataset was prepared. The EDA included exploring the shape of the data, checking correlation matrix, bar charts, simple and complex plots like heat map and KDE and summary statistics.
New features were engineered with the data. One hot encoding was used to encode categorical variables. Missing values was invesgitated and was resolved.
Imbalanced was also checked and dealth with by using SMOTE. The training data	was trained on by training a Binary Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, a Support Vector Machine Classifier and an xgBoost classifier .
The Accuracy Score, Precision, Recall and Confusion Matrix were evaluated for each model with the hold-out test data. The ROC Curve for the five models was also plotted.
